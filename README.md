# CookFi AI

A degen cooking up alpha and gains.

## Key Goals:

1. **Autonomous Trading Agent**: Build an AI agent capable of fully autonomous buy and sell decisions on Solana, leveraging Web3 data and AI-driven analysis.
2. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Use data from platforms like Cookie, Dexscreener, and Birdeye, analyzing market conditions (e.g., liquidity, volume, and market cap) to guide investment choices.
3. **Custom Investment Strategy**: Develop a tailored investment strategy that accounts for risk levels, liquidity, and other market factors, guiding the agentâ€™s decision-making process.
4. **Automated Rebalancing**: Implement an automated system that allows the agent to monitor its portfolio and make sell decisions based on pre-defined triggers, ensuring optimal performance.
5. **Social Media Integration**: Allow the AI agent to autonomously manage a Twitter account, sharing updates on trades and investment decisions.
6. **Yield Optimization**: Explore DeFi protocols to maximize returns on the agent's holdings by generating yield alongside the trading strategy.
